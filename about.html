                    <p class="our-ex-content">Easy Company, and Easy Junk removal are named after the unit that Kyle's grandfather served in during WWII, Easy Company of the 506th regiment, 101st Airborne Division. His grandfather, Gordon Carson, jumped into Normandy, Holland, and also fought and was wounded in the battle of the bulge. He survived his wounds and rejoined Easy Company. During the last months of the war, Easy Company liberated a Nazi prison camp - and this is where he met Kyle's grandmother, Antonia. She spoke six languages and served as a translator to help Easy Company coordinate transportation for prisoners from all over Europe back to their homeland. Kyle's father, Gary, was conceived in that same prison camp, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1946. The values and work ethic that Kyle's grandparents taught him are the foundation of his core and dedication to service, and helping those in need.</p>
